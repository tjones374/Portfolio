    <p>A bit of a rebel without a cause, a free-spirited wild child, and a "Type A" personality with a wannabe "Type B"
      mindset.
      I consider myself a forever-student with a wanderlust for spending time in faraway places learning all I can about
      different
      cultures, history, and people. My guilty pleasures are true crime, biographies, and documentaries.
      If you see me on the train, I'm most likely listening to a podcast or reading while trying to avoid the unwelcome
      cell phone conversations of the truly oblivious. <br>
    </p>
    <p>My current mentors in coding are Colt Steele, Traversy Media, and freeCodeCamp. My mentors-of-the-moment in
      life are Brendon Bruchard, Michelle Obama, and the writings of Charles Bukowski (just to provide an interesting
      perspective). My mentors and gurus tend to change because I deeply believe that the right answers are always found
      within ourselves.<br>
    </p>
    <p>My copilot in life is my dog Murphy, otherwise known as 'The M Dog', 'Murphy Girl', or just plain 'Murph', and my
      biggest fans are my three kids; Noah, AnnaVi, and Addison. They're my heart and soul, the best of this life, and
      the force behind my mission to spread bits of good in the world.
