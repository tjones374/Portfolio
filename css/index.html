      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="C:\Users\tjone\Pictures\Saved Pictures\about-me-page.jpg" alt="Trudy Jones">
    <p>I'm a bit of a rebel without a cause and a free-spirited wild child with a fierce streak of Type A pulsing through my veins. A forever student with a wanderlust for 
      spending time in faraway places learning all I can about cultures, history, and people. My guilty pleasures are true crime, biographies, and documentaries.
      If you see me on the train, I'm most likely listening to a podcast or reading while trying to avoid the unwelcome cell phone conversations of the 
      truly oblivious. 
      <p>Currently, my mentors in coding are Colt Steele, Traversy Media, and freeCodeCamp. My mentors-of-the-moment in life are Brendon Bruchard,
        Michelle Obama, and the writings of Charles Bukowski (just to provide an interesting perspective). My mentors tend to change because I deeply believe that
        one must follow their own heart, mind, and intuition first and foremost. 
      <p>My copilot in life is my dog Murphy, otherwise known as 'The M Dog', 'Murphy Girl', or just plain 'Murph', and my biggest fans are my three kids;
        Noah, AnnaVi, and Addison. They're my heart and soul, the best of this life, and the force behind my passion for spreading bits of good in the world.
